Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

This week's task was to create a simple chatbot. This is my Knock Knock Machine. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started off by trying to take in all the information about Javascript given by our teachers in videos and other material while taking notes before starting on the project. I was stuck on the part where I was trying to make the chatbot make the next reply for a long time and asked both my peers for help and googled a lot. I think the stress of feeling that I didn't understand anything in the beginning made me overlook some important pointers for the task. I decided to rewatch the videos and read through the instructions carefully and then it got a bit easier. It was really difficult in the beginning to understand what specific errors I'd made and how the functions and event listeners worked. 

If I had more time I would definitely add more jokes, make the chatbot send a message if the input field is left empty (I actually made that work, but after I finally made chatbot move on to the next statement, that piece of code was making problems so I had to remove it), and put more time on the styling.
